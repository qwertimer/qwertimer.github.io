Welcome to my blog. This blog contains many of my delvings in linux,
python, microcontrollers, bash and deep learning. I hope you find
something useful on this site. The majority of posts will be 'how to'
articles and tech tips for linux based systems. Much of these posts have
been taken from my Zettlekasten repository on Github. If you wish to
learn more about Zettlekastens and the software i use check out the post
i have on this.
