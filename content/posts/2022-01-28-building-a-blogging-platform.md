Today begins a new era for my website. I am going to try and write more
blog posts. To begin with i created the website but had no decent
pipeline for uploading new content. I found qmacro had a great blogging
script and so have modified it to suit my needs. This way i can call
from the command line newblog and it will automatically create a
file in my posts category and add the boiler plate code. Then the script
drops me into vim to write my script. Once done the command adds the
post to the github repository and will automatically post it. Hopefully
this pipeline will make it more conducive for me to post to this page
and add more content to the blog.

Stay tuned for more.
